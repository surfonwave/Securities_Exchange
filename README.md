# Securities Exchange

## The Securities Exchange is a system for purchase and redeeming HotspotBnB cryptocurrency tokens.

### The Alpha version of this platform was built on Bitcoin. Moving forward the system will be dependant on Etheriums blockchain. 

### The tokens all represent beneficial interest in the HotspotBnB platform. The idea is that royalties generated from the technology platform will be distributed to the same wallet addresses where the tokens are being held, using smart contracts.
