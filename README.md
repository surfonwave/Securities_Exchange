Open Source Private Virtual Currency Securities Exchange (PVCSE)

This project permits any Tech Startup to raise funds, manage equity, trade shares and easily branch equity with the technology their developing without banks, contracts, over-regulation, beurocracy and trivial business managemenet tasks which distract the founders and developers from their core focus.

The PVCSE is an early project, but it is already being used with many tech startup's:
This website plugin gives your tech-startup's website:

(1) a control panel to manage the equity 
(2) a stock graph bar to put on the top of your website 
(3) a user interface (PHP/MYSQL) 
(4) quick start connections to Bitcoin

All matters surrounding this project should be directed to me:
